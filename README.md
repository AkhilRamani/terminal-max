# Terminal Max

###### Terminal re-imagined - with scalability in mind.

A visual terminal can run any command with simple clicks.

## Setup
Go `public/example.command.config.json` file and remove `example.` from the file name.

`command.config.json` file is used to configure the terminal UI and controls the command execution.
